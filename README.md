All the codes have been generated in Julia and R.

In Julia, the required packages are always included in a "to_include.jl" file.

To run a script:
- open a terminal
- cd into the appropriate folder
- run the "julia' or 'R' command (depending on what you want to run)
- run 'include("XXX.jl")' (for julia) or 'source("XXX.R")' (for R)
