- Switching to french because: syllable decomposition, isolating singular form, lemma...

- Switching to lists composed of two triplets.
- Triplets are built by maximizing the similarity value over one metric, and minimizing this value over all other metrics
    - Not necessarily possible with the slot coding model and the levenshtein distance
    - Five metrics: slot coding, closed biphone, open biphone, syllable metric, levenshtein distance
    - For the open biphone metric: openness of two biphones

- News on the semantic similarity - shall we take a new appointment?
